# Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Modern web browsers now enable us to create offline-capable Progressive Web Apps
(PWAs)!

PWAs are web apps that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like
experience to users. They evolve from pages in browser tabs to immersive,
top-level apps, maintaining the web's low friction at every moment.

Web apps can now go beyond the browser and install natively on iOS, Android, and
desktop. Add these new abilities using two main APIs: a web app manifest for
installation and a service worker for offline.
